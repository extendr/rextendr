Regardless of which operating system you use, we recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install and maintain your Rust toolchain. 
On Linux and OS X, you simply run the following command in a shell:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
No further action should be needed.

On Windows, things are a little more involved. First download `rustup‑init.exe` from the [rustup site](https://rustup.rs/) and run it, following the onscreen instructions. Then execute the following rustup commands:

```
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-gnu
```

Then install [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/). You need to do this even if you have Rtools installed already. At present, the Rust compiler doesn't play well with the tools shipped by Rtools.

Once msys2 is installed, install the mingw toolchain. We recommend doing this for both 32 and 64 bit.
```
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain   # 64-bit
pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-toolchain     # 32-bit
```

Finally, add `%MSYS_ROOT%\usr\bin`, `%MSYS_ROOT%\mingw32\bin`, and `%MSYS_ROOT%\mingw64\bin` to the PATH environment variable. For example, using the CMD shell:
```
set PATH=%MSYS_ROOT%\usr\bin;%MSYS_ROOT%\mingw32\bin;%MSYS_ROOT%\mingw64\bin;%PATH%
```
