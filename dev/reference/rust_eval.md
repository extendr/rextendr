# Evaluate Rust code

Compile and evaluate one or more Rust expressions. If the last
expression in the Rust code returns a value (i.e., does not end with
`;`), then this value is returned to R. The value returned does not need
to be of type `Robj`, as long as it can be cast into this type with
`.into()`. This conversion is done automatically, so you don't have to
worry about it in your code.

## Usage

``` r
rust_eval(code, env = parent.frame(), ...)
```

## Arguments

- code:

  Input rust code.

- env:

  The R environment in which the Rust code will be evaluated.

- ...:

  Other parameters handed off to
  [`rust_function()`](https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/dev/reference/rust_source.md).

## Value

The return value generated by the Rust code.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Rust code without return value, called only for its side effects
rust_eval(
  code = 'rprintln!("hello from Rust!");'
)

# Rust code with return value
rust_eval(
  code = "
    let x = 5;
    let y = 7;
    let z = x * y;
    z // return to R; rust_eval() takes care of type conversion code
 "
)
} # }
```
